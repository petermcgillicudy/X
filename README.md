# X: A Non-Modal Editor for the Terminal

X is a non-modal editor for the terminal that can be used by everybody, even those few who don't know Lisp. Everything works as in regular visual editors.

## What Does X Mean?

x is called x because x > vi. It's not much of a reason, but it’s technically correct and that’s good enough for me.

If you try `x` and you like it, you could go to wherever `vi` is installed and install `x` there. It’s a convenient place and... well, you can call it using one less character. That's something.

One\* could suggest that once you are there, you can proclaim proudly:

`echo x > vi`

That will show that you care about math and what is good and just.

#Why X?
X is simple, fast, and convenient. Also, we don’t want Elon Musk to buy a text editor for 1 trillion dollars and rename it x, right?

*Not me, for legal reasons.
