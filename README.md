# X: A Non-Modal Editor for the Terminal

X is a non-modal editor for the terminal that can be used by everybody, even those few who don't know Lisp. It works just like any other visual editor you might know.

## What Does X Mean?

X is called `x` because `x > vi`. It's not much of a reason, but it’s technically correct and that’s good enough for me.

If you give `x` a try and end up liking it, feel free to install it where `vi` is typically found. It's a handy spot, and hey, you save one character when typing the command. That counts for something.

Some[^1] might suggest that once you've done this, you can proudly declare:

`echo x > vi`

This shows your commitment to simplicity and fairness—mathematically speaking!

##Why Choose X?
* Simple: It’s easy to use.
* Fast: It runs smoothly without any fuss.
* Convenient: You don’t have to type vi anymore!
* And, most importantly, we want to avoid the scenario where Elon Musk buys a text editor for 1 trillion dollars and renames it to x. That would be absurd!
